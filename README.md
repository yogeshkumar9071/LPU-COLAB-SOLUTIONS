## Autotyper

To enhance your experience when using the solutions provided in this repository, i've included a convenient "Autotyper" tool.

1. Download the [Autotyper](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ultimatebot/)
2. Open the folder and extract it.
3. Now, double-click "Ultimate Bot setup" and then it should be installed.

### How to Use the Autotyper

1. Open the autotyper and Press "yes" for all the notifications it shows.
2. Now, copy the required answer from the repository and then paste it in the box that says "Your custom text here".
3. Now, select "custom text" from the radio buttons and adjust the speed.
4. Now change the time for starting the autotyper based on your requirements.
5. Now press start and then place the cursor on LPUCOLAB, where we write the code, and then right click.
6. The autotyper should start writing the code based on the time you selected for it to start.
